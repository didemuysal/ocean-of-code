# Ocean Of Code
Implementation of the Ocean of Code challenge on Scala language by Didem Uysal - 20160808015.  
The code base aims to work on codingame.com

I proceeded with the instructions given, I did not use any algortima I created. Basic explanation of the algorithm is submarine moves or fires according to the inputs received. Then it puts himself on hold according to the result. Loss of life due to random direction selection.Because of not using any Path Finding Algorithm, it sometimes created traps on his own between the islands or when the islands were near a corner, and he could not come out and stucked. In the next phases, backtracking algorithm can be implemented and due to the size of the map part, the bot can be improved and it could decided a direction in a particular position and get better scores as a future work.

Due to the time constraint, I could not fix all bugs in the code. For an additional period of time, the code can be fixed, implemented with new algorithms and executed with better quailty.
